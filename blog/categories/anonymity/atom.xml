    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello. My name is Longsley and I am brand new. I am hoping to build from scratch a network of like-minded individuals who share my passion for the use of technology to improve the world. I believe war and inequality can be made obsolete. I hope to explore these and other topics through blogging and other online social activities. I also aim to do this completely anonymously.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My reasons for maintaining my anonymity are varied and complex and will be explored in future blog posts. The short explanation is that I can truly speak my mind only if I don&rsquo;t have to worry about how my views and words will affect the ones I love.</p>

<p>To secure my anonymity, I have endeavored to only connect to services related to Longsley via <a href="http://torproject.org">Tor</a>. I have settled for a Yandex email address as the major webmail providers require phone numbers these days. My Twitter account is currently <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/15790">suspended</a> (likely due to connecting through Tor and signing up with a Yandex email address&hellip;), but I have filed an appeal and have every expectation that it will be reinstated. I have also kept completely silent about this project to anyone with whom I have a personal connection.</p>

<p>My anonymity is not perfect. The Tor network could be compromised. My hardware or software could be backdoored. I could eventually make a mistake and access Longsley-related services in an insecure manner. The important thing is that I&rsquo;ve taken the precautions I am willing to take and I am now confident enough to go to work.</p>

<h3>I need your help</h3>

<p>As Longsley, I have no contacts. I know no one. I have words and ideas and passion and ambition and brains and guts, but I have no influence. I can publish this post and if I don&rsquo;t post to Reddit or Hacker News, literally no one but me will see it. Please help me be heard. Share me to communities that would benefit from my words. Follow me on Twitter (when my account is unsuspended). Email me (longsley lowercaseAwithAcircleAroundIt yandex.com) to let me know your thoughts and point me in the right direction. I realize I haven&rsquo;t yet posted anything of note. I may need to prove myself to you. I will write posts worth sharing so please don&rsquo;t forget about me.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Longsley</p>
